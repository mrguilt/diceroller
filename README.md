# diceroller

This is a command line dice roller. Currently, it will only only roll one die so-many times. 

## Operation

The command line is:

```
diceroller CdS
```

Where:
    `C` Number of times to roll the dice
    `S` Number of sides on the dice

So `diceroller 2d6` will roll a 6-side die two times (so, two results between 1 and 6, or a total between 2 and 12).
